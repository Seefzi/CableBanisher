# CableBanisher
Sets up a network adapter for use with Meta Airlink or Virtual Desktop.

HOW TO USE:

Download and extract the .zip file from the latest release. 
Extract it to its own directory, preferably.
Run CableBanisher.exe.
Find the network adapter you want to use for Airlink/Virtual Desktop.
Type 's', the number next to the adapter of choice, then hit enter.
Wait a bit. It'll tell you when it's done.

NOTE: If you are experiencing slower than expected speeds, it may be necessary to connect another Wi-Fi 6 capable device to the hotspot first. I'm not entirely sure why this is, but it's a relatively simple if annoying fix.

RESET NETWORK ADAPTER:

Run CableBanisher.exe.
Find the network adapter from before.
Type 'd', the number next to your adapter, then hit enter.
Wait a bit, don't close the program right away. It'll tell you when it's done.
It may or may not successfully disable your hotspot. The Windows API for it times out a lot. Your network adapter will be useable regardless.
